== Playing around with Pet-Clinic App:

=== Adding a new Owner:
. Launch the app by visiting [blue]#** http://localhost:8082/petclinic/login **# 
+
image::O1.png[O1]
.. Click Owners
+
image::O2.png[O2]
.. You will be redirected to [green]#**Owners**# page
+
image::O3.png[O3]
.. Click [green]#**Add Owner**#
+
image::O3a.png[O3a]
.. You will be redirected to [green]#**Add Owners**# page
+
image::O4.png[O4]

+
image::O5.png[O5]
.. Click [green]#**Submit**#
+
image::O5a.png[O5a]
.. You can view the details in [green]#**Owners**# page
+
image::O6.png[O6]

=== Adding a new column:

+
image::O1.png[O1]
. Click [green]#**Owners**#
+
image::O2.png[O2]
. You will be re-directed to Owners page. You can view the Owner details with  4 coloumns [green]#**First Name, Last Name, Owner City, Telephone**# . Let us try to display one more column [green]#**Zip Code**# in this page. Copy [green]#**vpOwner**# string from the url, as we are trying to search for the page that contains the column names to be displayed.
+
image::C11a.png[C11]
.  Goto [navy]#**STS**#, Click on [navy]#**Search--> File**#
+
image::C12.png[C11]
. In [navy]#**File Search**# tab, type [green]#**vpOwner**# in [navy]#**Containing text**# textbox. Click [navy]#**Search**#
+
image::C13.png[C11]
. You can see a list of files that contains [green]#**vpOwner**#
+
image::C14.png[C11]
. There are 2 classes where we have [green]#**vpOwner**# : [navy]#**VROwner**# and [navy]#**VROwnerLanding.java**#
+
image::C15.png[C11]
. Framework uses the convention of [green]#**'VP'**# to denote  a page.Let us open the class [navy]#**VROwnerLanding.java **# as we have [green]#**'VP'**#  in this class.
+
image::C16.png[C11]
. We could see that [green]#**owners**# are of type [green]#**OwnerLineItem**#. 
+
image::C17.png[C11]
. Find [navy]#**OwnerLineItem.java **# inside [navy]#** com.anthem.client.extension.petclinic->com.atlas.client.extension.petclininc.view->OwnerLineItem.java **#
+
image::C18.png[C11]
. Open [navy]#**OwnerLineItem.java **# . You can see the columns names [green]#**First Name, Last Name, Owner City, Telephone**# which are displayed in the Owners page.
+
image::C19.png[C11]
.  Lets add a piece of code to display [green]#** Zipcode **# as well
+
image::C2a.png[C2a]

. In [navy]#**OwnerLineItem.java **#  , you can see that this class is mapped to [navy]#**Owner.class**#
+
image::C2b.png[C11]
. Find [navy]#**Owner.java **# inside [navy]#** com.anthem.client.extension.petclinic->com.atlas.client.extension.petclininc.core->Owner.java **#
+
image::C2c.png[C11]
. Since [navy]#**Owner.java **# is a core class , you can see the declaration/representation of all columns in the database here.
+
image::C22.png[C11]


. Launch the app by visiting [blue]#** http://localhost:8082/petclinic/login **# . Click [green]#**Owners**# and then click [green]#**Add Owner**#
+
image::C23.png[C11]

. Enter the value for [green]#**Zipcode **# 

+
image::C24.png[C11]

. Enter the details and click [green]#**Submit**#

+
image::C25.png[C11]

. You can see the column [green]#**Zipcode**# and its value displayed

+
image::C26.png[C11]

image::CMN3.png[03]
. As in previous example,let us open the class [navy]#**VROwnerLanding.java **# 
+
image::C16.png[C11]
. We could see that the instance [green]#**owners**# are of type [green]#**OwnerLineItem**#
+
image::C17.png[C11]
. Find [navy]#**OwnerLineItem.java **# inside [navy]#** com.anthem.client.extension.petclinic->com.atlas.client.extension.petclininc.view->OwnerLineItem.java **#
+
image::C18.png[C11]
. Open [navy]#**OwnerLineItem.java **# . You can see the lines of code for actions [green]#**'Edit' **# and [green]#** 'Owner Info' **#
+
image::C2d.png[C11]
. Let us add a piece of code to perform the action [green]#** 'Delete' **# in [navy]#**OwnerLineItem.java **# 
+
image::C2e.png[C11]
. Launch the app by visiting [blue]#** http://localhost:8082/petclinic/login **# 
+
image::CMN1.png[O1]
